The file cnn.py contains the code for Convolutional Neural Network architecture that we used to build the model for training
on your dataset. 
For running this code three files are required:
1. Training Variants
2. Training Text
3. PreTrained Word2Vec models - ../embeddings/w2vmodeladdeddata
Additionally it is dependent on the Keras, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Gensim, Pandas and Numpy libraries
After keeping the files, the program can be run using the command: python cnn.py
