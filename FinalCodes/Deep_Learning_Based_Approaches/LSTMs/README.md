--------------- README ------------------

The file LSTM_Learn.py contain the code for implementing
two types of LSTM architecture: the vanilla version and
hierarchial LSTM. The code automatically runs both these functions and 
saves the respective models.

------------ Dependencies -----------
To run this file please follow the following steps:
1. Download Training_text, Training_variants, stage2_test_text, stage2_test_variants
from the following links:
	https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment/data

2. Download the dictionaries from the drive link: 
	https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Fdg67U6eylgcnK5K8yZydyRLTfvhQmnL?usp=sharing

Note: Keep all these files in the same directory as the code and then run the file: python LSTM_Learn.py

------ Output -----

The code saves the models for the respective architectures which could be used again for generating the 
submission files.
