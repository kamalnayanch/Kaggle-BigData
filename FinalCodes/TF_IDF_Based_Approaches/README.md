------- README for version 1 --------

The file TF_IDF_v1.py contain the code for implementing
the TF-IDF architecture described in the project report.
The code automatically runs the architecture and saves the
submission files using Logistic Regression, LightGBM, XGboost,
and random forest.

------------ Dependencies -----------
To run this file please follow the following steps:
1. Download Training_text, Training_variants, stage2_test_text, stage2_test_variants
from the following links:
	https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment/data

Note: Keep all these files in the same directory as the code and then run the file: python TF_IDF_v1.py

------ Output -----

The code saves the submission files for the respective algorithms on top of TF-IDF architecture.
