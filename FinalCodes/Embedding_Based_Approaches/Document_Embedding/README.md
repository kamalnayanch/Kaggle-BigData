Filename: final_doc2vec.py

Input files:

Kaggle Dataset --

1. training_variants
2. stage2_test_variants.csv
3. training_text
4. stage2_test_text.csv

Model --

Note: Code only takes path to the file docEmbeddings.d2v. Yet, all the below files should be in the same directory as the code

1. docEmbeddings.d2v 
2. docEmbeddings.d2v.syn1neg.npy
3. docEmbeddings.d2v.wv.syn0.npy

To run file (assuming all the datasets are in the same directory as the code):
python final_doc2vec.py
